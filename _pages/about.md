I am a PhD student in Physics, currently working on active matter systems. My research focuses on developing and analyzing numerical simulations to study the collective behavior and emergent dynamics of complex systems out of equilibrium.

I hold a Master’s degree in Physics of Complex Systems from Politecnico di Torino, SISSA/ICTP (Trieste), and Université Paris Cité, where I worked on Boltzmann inversion methods and force inference models to extract effective interactions from experimental data.

My scientific interests lie at the intersection of statistical physics, computational modeling, and data-driven inference, with a broader curiosity for problems bridging physics, machine learning, and biophysics.

Beyond research, I enjoy teaching, coding, and sharing physics concepts in an accessible way. In my free time, you’ll often find me exploring new ideas, learning new tools, or staying active through sports.
