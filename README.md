The bachelor experience in Engineering provided me with tools in coding, signal analysis, solid state physics and experimental techniques that I like to apply to different fields.

### Maturità Scientifica / I.I.S. Copernico Luxemburg Torino
 Final Grade 100/100
 
My high school experience helped me develop my passions towards mathematics and physics, but most importantly humanistics subjects contributed to the open-mindedness that characterizes me.

## Experience
### Teaching Tutor / Politecnico di Torino
Courses: Mathematical Analysis I, Physics I 

This experience consisted in helping first-year students with frontal exercise sessions regarding  two of the most challenging courses given by Politecnico. It helped me develop my skills in public speaking and reinforce my love for teaching and helping others.

### Voluntary Work / Torino
During the years I’ve gathered hundreds of hours in close contact with people and children as a volunteer and an entertainer. This helped me learn new skills about team working, problem solving and empathy.
