I am a Master's student in Physics of Complex Systems, currently studying at Politecnico di Torino, SISSA/ICTP (Trieste), and Université Paris Cité. My academic journey has been driven by a deep curiosity for statistical physics, computational methods, and stochastic processes, with applications ranging from condensed matter systems to data-driven inference techniques.

My research focuses on developing Monte Carlo simulations, Boltzmann inversion methods, and force inference models to better understand complex interacting systems. As part of my Master's thesis, I am working on inferring particle interactions from experimental data, a project that bridges physics, statistical learning, and computational modeling.

I am passionate about applying computational physics and statistical modeling to real-world problems, whether in academia or industry. In my free time, I enjoy coding, exploring interdisciplinary research topics, and sharing knowledge through scientific outreach.
